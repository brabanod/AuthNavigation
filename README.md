# AuthNavigation

AuthNavigation is an iOS library, that organizes the login process in your app, making it easy to implement auto-login. AuthNavigation cares about presenting the correct view controllers, by automatically checking if your user needs to login or not.

You can setup AuthNavigation on one or more `UIViewController`'s, it can authenticate the whole screen or just parts of it.

## What it's not
AuthNavigation does not give you ready-to-use login and loading screen templates. AuthNavigation gives the navigation structure to create a simple login process with additional loading page, the design has to be done independently.

AuthNavigation is not a replacement for `UINavigationController`, in fact you can use both side by side.




## Flow
This is a summary of the login flow in a simple diagram:

## Installation


### Manual

You can simply drag the files from the `Source` folder into you project and use the classes.


### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. To integrate AuthNavigation into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'AuthNavigation', '~> 1.1'
end
```

## Usage
There are two ways to use AuthNavigation:

* **Basic (Login):** `HostVC` is protected by a login screen `LoginVC`. AuthNavigation will check whether to present this login screen or not

* **Advanced (Login + Loading):** Basic + `LoadingVC` which will be presented before `LoginVC`. May be useful if you have to request a server to check whether user should login or not.


Follow the below steps to integrate AuthNavigation in your project:



### Interface setup
Create 2 VC's for *Basic* and 3 for *Advance* (Specify unique Storybard ID's for each)



### HostVC setup
First create an `AUAuthNavigator` instance (you can either use the `AUAuthNavigator.sharedInstance` or you create your own static instance). Then set the Storyboard ID's of `LoginVC` and `LoadingVC` to the corresponding properties. To actually use the authenticator, call `startAuthentication` in `viewWillAppear` and call `stopAuthentication` in `viewDidDisappear`.

```swift
class HostVC: UIViewController {
    
    static let authNavigator = AUAuthNavigator()
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    
        MainViewController.authNavigator.delegate = self
           
        MainViewController.authNavigator.loginVCId = "LoginVC"
        MainViewController.authNavigator.loadingVCId = "LoadingVC"
    }

    override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        MainViewController.authNavigator.startAuthentication()
    }
    
    override func viewWillDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
        MainViewController.authNavigator.stopAuthentication()
    }
}
```

Set the delegate of the authenticator to `self`. ThereforeÂ `HostVC` needs to coform to the `AUAuthenticatable` protocol:

```swift
extension HostVC: AUAuthenticatable {
    
    func shouldLogin() -> Bool {
        // Implement your authentication process here. If your user needs to login, return true, if he is already logged in return false
    }
    
    func willReturnFromLoginActions(success: Bool) {
        // Additional actions after login (not necessary)
    }
}
```



### LoadingVC setup
After your custom loading is finished, call `finishLoading()` on the static `authNavigator` instance of `HostVC`.



### LoginVC setup
After login is finished, call `finishLogin(success: Bool)` on the static `authNavigator` instance of `HostVC`. Remember that you may want to handle login failure on the `LoginVC` itself instead of callin `finishLogin(succes: false)`, because this will only show the login screen again.



### Logout
Call `logout(presentLoading: Bool)` in your to `HostVC`. If `presentLoading` is set to `true`, the loading screen will be presented, if it's set to `false`, the login screen will be presented directly.


### Additional settings for AUAuthenticator

* **`hostView`:** This is the container view for your login and loading screen, setting this to a specific view in your `HostVC` can be useful if you don't want the entire screen to be covered by the authentication. By default it's set to the entire screen.
* **`overlayColor`:** The overlay is used to hide the content of your `HostVC` during authorization. If you need this overlay to have a special color, then specify it here. Default behaviour is to use the background color of the `hostView`.
* **`animationDuration`:** Here you can specify a custom duration for all animations done by AUAuthNavigator (overlay, login and loading fade in/out).
